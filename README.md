### Database Schema

The application uses MySQL with four main tables:

- **tasks** - Stores assignments with title, deadline, estimated hours, and status
- **sessions** - Logs study sessions with duration and task associations
- **reflections** - Saves weekly reflection entries
- **preferences** - Stores user settings (optional)

## Database Setup

This project uses a MySQL database (e.g., Aiven MySQL) with a schema managed by a Python setup script.[1]

### 1. Create `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your database credentials:[2]

```env
DB_HOST=your-mysql-host
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=your-username
DB_PASS=your-password
DB_NAME=KronosDB
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Install the required Python packages:[1][2]

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python python-dotenv
```

### 3. Run the database builder

The project includes a `DatabaseBuilder` class that will:

- Connect to the MySQL server  
- Create the `KronosDB` database if it does not exist  
- Create the `Tasks`, `Sessions`, and `Reflections` tables with the correct schema[1]

Run the setup script:

```bash
python path/to/your_database_builder_script.py
```

If the script finishes without errors, the database and all tables are ready to use.

## 🔒 Database Configuration

The application connects to a MySQL database hosted on Aiven cloud:

```python
config = {
    'host': 'apex-2025-ekco-2048.e.aivencloud.com',
    'user': 'avnadmin',
    'password': os.getenv('DB_PASS'),
    'port': 21911,
    'database': 'KRONOS',
    'ssl_disabled': True
}
```

**Note:** Database credentials are stored in `.env` file and excluded from version control for security.
